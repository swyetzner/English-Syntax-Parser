# English-Syntax-Parser
A project I created for my Programming class in early 2015 using the Natural Language Processing Kit library. It takes English sentences and creates a phrase structure tree based on linguistic PSRs. Right now this functionality is being used to combine sentences for demo purposes. Including zero arguments with the program name prints out a demo I used in class, one argument prints a syntax tree produced by parsing that argument, and two arguments prints out the combined result of the two.
